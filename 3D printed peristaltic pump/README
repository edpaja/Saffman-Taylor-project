The .STL files I used to 3D print the peristaltic pumps I used to control the inflow of the lower viscosity fluid(usually water) into 
the Hele-Shaw cell. I use a NEMA-17 stepper motor which has a torque of 45Ncm and a step angle of 1.8Â°. I have also attached the arduino 
file used to control the motor.
