# Saffman-Taylor-project

When a fluid of lower viscosity displaces a fluid of higher viscosity in a porous medium, an instability occurs at the interface between both fluids. This instability is called the Saffman-Taylor instability [1] (or viscous fingering) and appears in many natural and industrial processes. One common way to study this effect is by injecting the lower viscosity fluid into the center of a Hele-Shaw cell containing the more viscous fluid. 

In this project, I am studying the effect of the injection flow on the deformation of the interface between the two fluids. I am also interested in comparing experimental results to numerical results and seeing if numerical simulations may help explain or better understand the experimental results.

In this folder, you will find information pertaining to my experimental setup, results, methodology, references and various other important documents.
